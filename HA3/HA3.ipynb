    "\n",
    "It is extremely important to make sure that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Everything runs as expected (no bugs when running cells);\n",
    "2. The output from each cell corresponds to its code (don't change any cell's contents without rerunning it afterwards);\n",
    "3. All outputs are present (don't delete any of the outputs);\n",
    "4. Fill in all the places that say `# YOUR CODE HERE`, or \"**Your answer:** (fill in here)\".\n",
    "5. Never copy/paste any notebook cells. Inserting new cells is allowed, but it should not be necessary.\n",
    "6. The notebook contains some hidden metadata which is important during our grading process. **Make sure not to corrupt any of this metadata!** The metadata may for example be corrupted if you copy/paste any notebook cells, or if you perform an unsuccessful git merge / git pull. It may also be pruned completely if using Google Colab, so watch out for this. Searching for \"nbgrader\" when opening the notebook in a text editor should take you to the important metadata entries.\n",
    "7. Although we will try our very best to avoid this, it may happen that bugs are found after an assignment is released, and that we will push an updated version of the assignment to GitHub. If this happens, it is important that you update to the new version, while making sure the notebook metadata is properly updated as well. The safest way to make sure nothing gets messed up is to start from scratch on a clean updated version of the notebook, copy/pasting your code from the cells of the previous version into the cells of the new version.\n",
    "8. If you need to have multiple parallel versions of this notebook, make sure not to move them to another directory.\n",
    "9. Although not forced to work exclusively in the course `conda` environment, you need to make sure that the notebook will run in that environment, i.e. that you have not added any additional dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FOR HA1, HA2, HA3 ONLY:** Failing to meet any of these requirements might lead to either a subtraction of POEs (at best) or a request for resubmission (at worst).\n",
    "\n",
    "We advise you to perform the following steps before submission to ensure that requirements 1, 2, and 3 are always met: **Restart the kernel** (in the menubar, select Kernel$\\rightarrow$Restart) and then **run all cells** (in the menubar, select Cell$\\rightarrow$Run All). This might require a bit of time, so plan ahead for this (and possibly use Google Cloud's GPU in HA1 and HA2 for this step). Finally press the \"Save and Checkout\" button before handing in, to make sure that all your changes are saved to this .ipynb file."

    "**Your answer:** Yes, the policy for state 8, 12,13 and 14 have changed. This is because when discount factor is decreased, the policy will take less into account the possible following states, meaning that eg. for state 8, if you take action N there is a 10% chance of going E to the -1 reward state. When the discount factor is 0.99 this is taken into account very well, and the policy is instead W, to avoind the bad state s_9 completely. When gamma is only 0.9, however, this is not considered as much, which leads to the immediate return having a larger inpact for the optimal value function, and the action N is chosen instead. If gamma is decreased further to 0.8, the state s_11 will change policy from W to E, and take a shortcut by the bad state s_9. \n",

Since there is a 20% orthogonal path chance, we will evenutually end up in our terminal state. In this case, because of the layout of the grid, we will most likely end up with a positive reward, which will increase the Q-value for north, in most states.

    "# Task 3: Deep Double Q-learning (DDQN)\n",
    "For this task, you will implement a DDQN (double deep Q-learning network) to solve one of the problems of the OpenAI gym. Before we get into details about these type of networks, let's first review the simpler, DQN (deep Q-learning network) version.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Again, note that in the end we will implement DDQN, and not DQN.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deep Q Networks (DQN)\n",
    "As we saw in the video lectures, using a neural network as a state action value approximator is a great idea. However, if one tries to use this approach with Q-learning, it's very likely that the optimization will be very unstable. To remediate this, two main ideas are used.\n",
    "- First, we use experience replay, in order to decorrelate the experience samples we obtain when exploring the environment.\n",
    "- Second, we use two networks instead of one, in order to fix the optimization targets. Each of these ideas are explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Experience replay\n",
    "Since Q-learning is an off-policy algorithm, we may collect data by navigating in the environment using some choice of behavioral / exploratory policy $\\mu$ (e.g. $\\epsilon$-greedy), while still learning the $Q$ values for an optimal policy. Experience replay exploits this even further, and re-uses old data, which was collected using whatever exploratory policy we used at that moment (e.g. $\\epsilon$-greedy w.r.t. to those approximate $Q$ values).\n",
    "\n",
    "Except for re-using already collected data, another advantage of experience replay is that it allows us to decorrelate the data, by sampling experience from very different parts of the environment, rather than using the samples for training in the order they were collected when walking around in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorrelating the data is essential for training neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fixing the optimization target\n",
    "That is, for a given minibatch sampled from the replay buffer, we'll optimize the weights of only one of the networks (commonly denoted as the \"online\" network), using the gradients w.r.t a loss function. This loss function is computed as the mean squared error between the current action values, computed according to the **online** network, and the Q targets, computed using the other, **offline network** (which we'll also refer to as the fixed network or target network).\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the loss function is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\left(Q(s_i,a_i; \\theta\\right) - Y_i)^2~,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the number of samples in your minibatch, $Q(s,a;\\theta)$ is the state action value estimate, according to the online network (with parameters $\\theta$), and $Y_t$ is the Q target, computed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Y_i = r_i +  \\gamma ~\\underset{a}{\\text{max}}~Q(s_i', a; \\theta^-)~, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Q(s', a;\\theta')$ is the action value estimate, according to the offline network (with parameters $\\theta^-$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, so that the offline parameters are also updated, we periodically copy the parameters from the online to the offline network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training loop essentials\n",
    "The following key components are repeated for every time step $t$ in an episode:\n",
    "1. Sample an action $a_t$ from the $\\epsilon$-greedy policy w.r.t. the current estimated $Q$ values (online network), and execute the action in the environment.\n",
    "1. The current transition $(s_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1})$ is stored in the replay buffer.\n",
    "1. An entire mini-batch of transitions is sampled from the replay buffer, and a gradient step is taken to improve the online network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Double Deep Q Networks (DDQN)\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea explained above works well in practice, but later it was discovered that this approach is very prone to overestimating the state action values. The main reason for this is that the max operator, used to select the greedy action when computing the Q target, uses the same values both to select and to evaluate an action (this tends to prefer overestimated actions). In order to prevent this, we can decouple the selection from the evaluation, which is the idea that created DDQN. More concretely, the Q target for a DDQN is now \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Y_i = r_i + \\gamma Q(s_i', \\underset{a}{\\text{argmax}}Q(s_i',a;\\theta); \\theta^-)~. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we're using the **online** network to select which action is best, but we use the **offline** network to evaluate the state action value for that chosen action in the next state. This is what makes DDQN not overestimate (as much) the state action values, which in turn helps us to train faster and obtain better policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while the online network is constantly updated (as opposed to the offline network), the Q target (in which both the online and offline network are included for DDQN) should always be regarded as a constant when taking the gradient steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Several different optimization targets which are estimated with some $q$ function are often jointly referred to as \"TD targets\".\n",
    "We strive to be consistent and separate on-policy \"TD(0) targets\" and off-policy \"Q targets\" but in other places this distinction may be less clear."

    "One solution could be to implement the previous state in order to know the direction and velocity of the environment state (eg the ping pong ball), and thus we could predict the next state of the environment. If we also add a second previous state at t-2, we could estimate the acceleration of the environment state, which may be useful for e.g. ping pong or space invaders. This would not be necessary for e.g. pac man where there is no acceleration of the environment (ghosts).\n",
    "\n",
    "Without these changes, we would not be able to predict upcoming states, and could thus not optimise our own actions. For example, if you in pac man don't know which direction the ghosts are travelling you would have to move about only at a safe distance from the ghosts and only at spaces where there is no chance of getting caught at a dead end. This will most likely mean you cannot achieve the highest score, because of the pattern in which the ghosts move. If you do know their movement pattern however, you can follow behind them, and hide in side ailes/pockets, in order to get to places \"behind\" them, which is necessary to get all points.\n",

    "^Implement q-learning since this algorithm will predict the optimal path by exploring the enviroment around. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Another solution is to implement a sequence of previous actions and observations in order to learn the game strategy. Hence, with these sequences, s_t, the Markov Decision process is then known and can be used to predict the optimal game strategy with e.g. value iteration, Monte Carlo or TD.)"
